It is a type of investment fund that trades on an exchange like a stock, which allows it to be bought and sold throughout the day at market prices. An ETF invests in a diversified basket of assets such as stocks or bonds, and its value reflects the performance of those underlying assets. Unlike mutual funds, which are priced only once per day after the markets close, ETF prices change continuously throughout the trading day depending on supply and demand for the fund.
