An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a financial instrument that represents a basket of securities such as stocks, bonds or commodities. It operates like a mutual fund but trades on an exchange like a stock, which allows for more flexibility in trading. The price of an ETF typically reflects the value of the assets it holds.

An ETF stands for Exchange Traded Fund. It is a type of investment fund that trades on an exchange like a stock, which allows it to be bought and sold throughout the day at market prices. An ETF invests in a diversified basket of assets such as stocks or bonds, and its value reflects the performance of those underlying assets. Unlike mutual funds, which are priced only once per day after the markets close, ETF prices change continuously throughout the trading day depending on supply and demand for the fund.
